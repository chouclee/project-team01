Macroautophagy involves the formation of double-membrane-bounded autophagosomes which enclose the cytoplasmic constituent targeted for degradation in a membrane-bounded structure, which then fuse with the lysosome (or vacuole) releasing a single-membrane-bounded autophagic bodies which are then degraded within the lysosome (or vacuole). Though once thought to be a purely non-selective process, it appears that some types of macroautophagy, e.g. macropexophagy, macromitophagy, may involve selective targeting of the targets to be degraded."

The association between fasting glucose and log-transformed 25OHD concentration was of borderline significance after accounting for ethnicity, age and body mass index in multivariate analyses (-0.13, -0.26 to 0.01). The odds ratio of gestational diabetes in women with 25OHD < 50 nmol/l did not reach statistical significance (1.92, 95% confidence interval 0.89-4.17). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal 25OHD concentrations are inversely related to fasting glucose, although further studies are required to establish whether this is independent of the effects of ethnic background.",

Our results demonstrated that the mutation in the FHIT gene significantly reduced FHIT expression in human CRC. Both TUNEL and TMA experiments demonstrated significantly inhibited apoptosis by down-regulation of Bax and up-regulation of Survivin and Bcl-2. Collectively, these studies identify the mechanism by which an important tumor suppressor gene, FHIT, inactivated specifically in human CRC, and contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis.",

Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies.",

Due to selective pressure, noncoding functional elements such as enhancers tend to evolve slowly compared to their neighboring sequences and hence can be identified as conserved noncoding elements in comparisons of related genomes. This strategy has been effectively used to identify a large number of putative enhancers conserved in distantly related vertebrates such as mammals and teleost fishes [26], [27], [28], [29]. Functional assay of such elements in transgenic mouse and zebrafish have indeed indicated that a large number of them function as transcriptional enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of reporter genes during embryonic development [26], [28], [29]. We have aligned sequences of the Lhx2 locus from human, mouse and pufferfish (fugu) genomes and predicted conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the locus. Functional assay of these CNEs in a transgenic mouse assay system showed that half of them function as tissue-specific enhancers at embryonic day 11.5.",

The miR-29 family targets a cadre of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in fibrosis, including multiple collagens, fibrillins, and elastin. Thus, down-regulation of miR-29 would be predicted to derepress the expression of these mRNAs and enhance the fibrotic response. Indeed, down-regulation of miR-29 with anti-miRs in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of collagens, whereas over-expression of miR-29 in fibroblasts reduces collagen expression. We conclude that miR-29 acts as a regulator of cardiac fibrosis and represents a potential therapeutic target for tissue fibrosis in general.",

Interestingly, ZEB1 produces two splice variants, Zfhep1 (NP_037296.1, ENSRNOT00000046013) and Zfhep2 (ZEB1, ENSRNOT00000024336), for which exon 4 (NP_037296.1 exon 1) is specific for the Zfhep1 variant (Figure 6B).
